                <p> My name is Jarod Fuentes, and I am a recent high school graduate from Lake Minneola High School. During my high school career, I took advantage of many programs that allowed me to grow and learn. I was apart of the Health Sciences Collegiate Academy, which allowed me to earn my AA Degree through the local college. I also participated in many other clubs on campus. Those include participation in multiple musical ensembles and sports teams. </p> <p> During high school, I was a member of the Lake Minneola Band Program. I play clarinet and alto saxophone in multiple ensembles. Some of these include marching band, symphonic band, concert band, and the top jazz band. </p>
